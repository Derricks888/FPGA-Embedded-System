This repository serves as the central hub for all of my FPGA, Embedded Systems, ASIC, and Digital Design work.
It contains complete FPGA systems, reusable IP blocks, verification environments, embedded software, and hardware bring-up documentation.

My projects span:

Intel MAX10 (DE10-Lite)

Xilinx Artix-7 (Nexys A7) (in progress)

BeagleBone Black AM335x Linux system

STM32 microcontroller firmware

Custom Verilog/VHDL reusable IP

Nios II embedded systems

Platform Designer (Qsys) SoC integration
